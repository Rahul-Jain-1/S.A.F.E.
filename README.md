# S.A.F.E (Secure App for Fraud Elimination)

## Project Description
SAFE, an ingenious solution crafted to combat the rising tide of harmful messages and deceptive deepfakes. Our video presentation illuminates the pressing challenges facing digital communication today. With the proliferation of malicious content and manipulative techniques, users are increasingly vulnerable to phishing, misinformation, and other digital threats.

Discover how SAFE seamlessly integrates into users' smartphones, providing a vigilant shield against potential hazards. As calls and messages arrive, the app diligently scans them, harnessing advanced algorithms to identify and neutralize harmful or suspicious content.

Administrators and cyber authorities gain access to a powerful web dashboard, delivering real-time insights and analytics derived from the app's data collection. This invaluable resource empowers security professionals to take immediate, targeted action, safeguarding communities from digital threats effectively.
